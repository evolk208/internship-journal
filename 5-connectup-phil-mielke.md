# May 30th ConnectUp with Phil Mielke 

Today I participated, remotely, in a ConnectUp discussion with Phil Mielke. ConnectUp is a series of roundtable discussions with experienced employees from across Esri. A group called e-bloc coordinates these discussions in addition to other events serving to connect employees in more social settings. 

Phil Mielke is currently an Industry Patterns Lead with the Patterns and Practices team at Esri, and is the former CIO of Redlands. His bio from ConnectUp is below! 

> Phil grew up working on farms in very (very) rural Indiana. He was an undergrad student when GIS became his passion. Earning Degrees in Biology and Philosophy, Phil’s first 1000 maps were of animal homerange tracking for the Wisconsin DNR. He digitized the 5 counties surrounding Dayton working for a regional Planning agency, and won an award from the AAG for Crime Analysis. After a stint as a commercial fisherman in Alaska, Phil moved to Redlands to work as an analyst and research coordinator on the National Institute of Justice’s COMPASS Program (Community Mapping, Planning and Analysis for Safety Strategies) where the first regional crime database was developed and shared with the public through a public mapping application. Phil was hired after the program ended as a Crime Analyst, became a GIS Supervisor and then CIO for the City of Redlands. During his tenure, he led implementation of an advanced citywide GIS winning several awards and led directors and council through several GeoDesign workshops for Capital Improvement and Planning. Philip also developed a crime analysis training course, trained dozens of police departments and several federal intelligence entities and devoted his MSGIS research for the tracking of Violent Sex and Gang Offenders with GPS anklets (leading to the first arrest based on GPS anklets). Phil has a passion for theater and music, having played and recorded with several groups. His band, All Marbles, can be found on Spotify, Itunes or dive bars in SoCal. Phil’s married to Jessi Mielke (also an Esri employee), and has 2 kids, Adelaide and Josephine (who don’t work at Esri yet, but their drawings are promising).
