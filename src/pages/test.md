# Esri in One Hour - GIS in Education, with Esther Worker

For my Esri in One Hour chat today, I met with Esther Worker. Esri is currently an Education Account Manager for the Mid West and Western US, and manages over 2,000 accounts (wow!). In our chat, we talked about ___ , ArcGIS use in education, and new goals and directions for increasing GIS use in education and beyond.

In 2014, Jack Dangermond donated ArcGIS Online to public, private, and home schools through President Barack Obama's ConnectED initiative. ConnectED, launched in 2013, importantly encouraged private technology companies to make in-kind contributions to the initiative, to increase the use of current technical teaching and learning solutions in schools to support technical readiness throughout levels of education.
