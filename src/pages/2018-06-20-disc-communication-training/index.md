Midway through this spring, following my acceptance of the Esri internship, Corianne (the internship coordinator) sent a communication assessment out to each of us interns. DISC is a behavior and communication assessment tool centering on four different behavioral traits that make up its acronym: dominance, inducement, submission, and compliance.

I enjoyed the phrasing Corianne used to preface this assessment: the results of the DISC assessment can help you understand your **comfort level** with different communication strategies. This is a great perspective on behavioral analysis, and one I hadn't fully thought of before. Understanding the communication strategies that are most comfortable, or "natural" to you, can help you more consciously flex into different communication styles, or, alternately, shape communication with other individuals in ways that work for you to be more comfortable. Distance from your point on the DISC square visualization is supposed to represent the **amount of energy it requires you to shift into these different styles**. This really clicked for me. I had never so clearly realized that any communication style can be flexed into, with proper recognition, but that it is difficult and uncomfortable in a way corresponding to this energy expenditure. This really shifted my perspective--certain communication styles come naturally to individuals, which can be thought of as their "resting" communication method, but any strategy can be met, with proper energy expenditure. It has been lastingly beneficial for me to now view communication in these terms. This "energy" model helps me to better understand when to pull back and rest in a natural communication strategy to focus on personal time and goals, and when to put in the uncomfortable effort to meet in the middle with someone with a vastly different communication strategy. This really puts communication on a sliding scale of effort, which it feels like, and also allows for the perspective that anyone can adopt certain communication accommodations--no one is entirely set in their ways, as long as they are willing to flex into accommodating alternate communication traits. 

The DISC assessment allows for 116 combinations of communication styles. After Corianne went through a brief background and overview of the DISC assessment, we went into a discussion of individual styles, with their common traits, including both fears and drives. We also noted the differences in ways different communication styles can be received, at their best and worst. 

## D 
D-style communication is **dominant**. Dominant communicators **fear** loss of control. In conversation, D-style communicators are strong-willed, and focused on the task at hand. They can be deadline-oriented, and are competitive. As a team member, D-styles are independent, at the risk of seeming self-centered. 

At the worst, D-styles can seem like they have a lack of concern for individuals on a team, as they are primarily task and deadline-oriented. However, they hold the ability to drive projects forward through this task-oriented focus. D-styles also embrace change as a mode of progress. Through this task-at-hand focus, flexibility in embracing change, and decisiveness, D-styles can effectively lead teams toward goals, rapid progress, and competitive advantage. 

## I
I-styles are known as **influencers**. In distinction from D-styles, I-styled are more focused on people; I-styles focus on relationships above the task-and-hand. I-styles are social, and on any topic--they blur the line between personal and professional life. Their attitude toward change and activity is usually "this is going to be fun, and let's have fun doing it!" 

Under pressure, I-styles can become disorganized. Their biggest fear is social rejection. However, with their ability to forge relationships with everyone around then, I-styles can make teams interpersonally positive. It is usually great to pair a D-style and an I-style to effectively lead teams; with this combination, a team can move forward with the drive of a D-style, while having the fun and positive relationships of an I-style. 

## S 
S-styles are steady. They are focused on relationships, but are on the reserved side. In general, S-styles are slower paced in communication, and are calm and patient. S-styles take all data points into consideration when making decisions. They are good listeners, and are trustworthy, as they keep to themselves, in contrast to I-styles. 

Corianne gave a good example of misreading communication traits in reference to this style. She noted that sometimes, S-styles can nod in acknowledgement of discussion. This can be read by a D-style as a sign of decisive agreement, where it is in fact a sign of an S-style listening, and they will need processing time to come to a true agreement about a decision, after thinking about all of the data points. 

Under pressure, S-styles can be too willing, and submissive to the point of being overextended. They fear a loss of stability, and with this, can be the first to question change. Their attitude toward "doing" is "Let's do it as we agreed," and they want everyone to be in agreement about team proceedings. S-styles are still people-oriented, but only most open when they have a relationship to a person they are communicating with (in contrast to the ever-social I-style). 

## C 
A C-style communicator is a conscientious team member. They are the most precise of the communicators. They are great at following precise instructions and workflows, and their attitude toward doing is "Let's do it right the first time." Where I-styles thrive in the brainstorming phase, C-styles are analytics, comprehensive, and organized when executing tasks. 

## Me 
From my spring DISC assessment, I am right on the line between D and I styles. My DISC breakdown is 50% D, 45% I, and 5% S. I think in team settings, I am task-oriented, independent, and driven in the way outline by the D-style description above. At my worst, I seem uncaring about relationships in teams, and am definitely driven by competition and completion of team goals. However, I am trying to be more accommodating and focused on building beneficial and fun relationships to help form supportive and respectful teams. I am resoundingly social, though shy, so may be growing into elements of an I-style. Like an I-style, when I am stressed, organization is one of the first things to slip. I consistently maintain rigid, task-oriented organization with team or project work, but my personal life (think: clean room) falls into disarray as a low priority in times of stress. 

I thought I would be more S-style and precise, and really talked through this with my fellow regional interns as we discussed our profiles. I view myself as analytical and detail oriented, and as the summer has progressed I've been monitoring this. I think in general I may be less S-style than my perception of myself. I do commonly favor fast decisions over pondering options for a lengthy amount of time, though I do feel like I closely analyze alternatives and tasks. I think the main distinction is I will almost always think in the big picture as opposed to rigid, precise tasks, and am willing to give up some of my analytical side in order to progress quickly to big-picture goals. It is interesting to note that my perceived need to adjust arrow points toward S, however, which fits with me constantly surrounding myself with analytical people, pursuits, and disciplines, such as engineering and development environments. 

## Discussion 
We talked in break-out groups with fellow regional interns across the country. I talked with interns based in St. Louis and North Carolina. I was hesitant and intimidated to participate in remote discussion through this webinar format, but we actually had incredibly fruitful conversation! This discussion with fellow interns around communication strategies, goals, work with our internship and coworkers, and each other will probably be one of the highlights of my summer. Alex, an intern in St. Louis, and I both felt like we had been mischaracterized in terms of not being much S-styles. However, we really talked through this, and I realized most of what I wrote in my profile above. We also had a group discussion of how we could get more confident in our internship positions through each of our communication styles, and how to capitalize on our most natural and strongest traits. This was a great time in the summer to step back, think about my needs and communication strengths, and find a way, with the advice of my fellow interns, to merge these into an even stronger way to approach my work interning at Esri and relationships with my coworkers. Corianne had noted earlier that overall, Esri as a company had very few D-styles. I thought a lot about how to bring my decisiveness, independence, and D-style leadership forward in asking for projects I was drawn to for the rest of my internship. We also brainstormed with each other about how to interact with our departments in ways that worked, or required more effort, for our communication styles. It was great to have this time in discussion with other interns, especially as I am still the only intern in the Denver office at this point.

It is fun to think about the communication styles of those around me, and I had a specific close friend in mind for each style to help me perceive the traits in action better. Also in this discussion, I thought a lot about the styles of my coworkers. It is helpful to note traits to look for in communication styles, which can be so beneficial in making accommodations for different communication strategies to get the most out of each individual. 

## Accommodations 
Corianne closed out our discussion for this workshop with some helpful tips for accommodations for each unique communication style. I've added a couple of key takeaways below, though at the root, any accommodation comes from recognizing a person's communication style, and adjusting to communication that is most comfortable for them. For your own style, it is important to note where other's perception of your style could be negative, and preface these areas with either an acknowledgement of how your strategy could be wrongly perceived, or working with your style to accent and complement teams with alternate styles. 

- Corianne mentioned a strategy she had used, which I also started to practice this year, of telling groups her strongest communication strategy as a point of understanding. For example, before speaking in a meeting she may be in charge of, she might say "I'm a D-style, and have been known to get hyper-focused on our goals for today. If at any point you feel like I'm not fully listening to you, it is not personal, and please let me know. I am goal-oriented, but do value my relationship with each of you more than any of our goals." I have also used a similar preface this year in meetings during points of stress in my year. At the beginning of the meeting, I will say "Just so everyone knows, I am in a point of stress with schoolwork, and if I ever get short, just let me know, and do not take it personally. I have been known to get short when I am stressed, and I do not want anyone to think this is a reflection of my respect for you." This has been helpful to be honest, and give individuals a heads up in how to approach your communication strategy and theirs with understanding. 
- I-styles talk with very expressive body language, and are also receptive to this communication. Expressive body language can make individuals feel like you are more engaged or approachable. 
- Give S and C-styles require ample time to make decisions. Never demand a quick decision from these analytical styles. A good way to approach this is to either give them ample lead time or thinking time afterward, such as "I've presented you all of the information, let's take a week and make a decision about this at next week's meeting." 
- C-styles really appreciate preparedness. When discussing things with a C-style, do your background research. Also, it is important to give these styles concrete individuals information to analyze. This can be in the form of an agenda before a meeting, or technical preparedness before communication about an issue. 
- As a D-style, be consciously patient, and really think about not rushing. Talk less, and listen more. 
- A D-style can work on building personal relationships by consciously setting aside time for "small talk." These can be built into daily time slots, and approached more like a task to work with your communication strategy. I had already started breaking up the day with lunch with my coworkers, and it is helpful to acknowledge why this worked for me to schedule in time for this relationship time, as I am very task-oriented and rarely blend projects and personal discussion. This is a really helpful point for me. 
- I-styles should focus on following up on tasks to stay focused. 
- S-styles emphasize "How?" It is important to answer this question, even when unprompted, to best communicate with an S-style. Clearly outline next-steps, and carefully discuss process. Do not hide any information, and be explicit in communication with an S-style. 
- Don't be pushy when talking to an I-style, and give them the opportunity to talk more. Let them "tell the best story," without feeling competition and without interruption. Be open to personal conversation with an I-style to better build a strong relationship. 
- Avoid exaggeration and be exacting in communication with a C-style. Exaggeration is often viewed as a negative. 
- Ask what C-styles consider important in discussion with them, as it is often insightful. C-styles often value high quality, and this can be very valuable. 

## Recommendation 
I have somewhat synthesized these options into thinking about how to best meet with a team in a way that allows for compromise between these communication styles. Here is a rough sketch of a meeting I have thought about that can cover some of these accommodations with different strategies. 
1. Provide a detailed agenda at least a week prior to a meeting, providing time to do background research
2. Do background research, yourself, to be prepared. 
3. Schedule time for small-talk into the meeting. We started doing this with Conference on World Affairs meetings, and it felt great. 
4. Don't force decision. Be patient, and allow for time after discussion before action is confirmed. 
5. Balance task-oriented drive with relationship-building, listening, trying to get agreement, and creating detailed steps forward. 

I got a lot out of this workshop, especially connecting with other interns, and will be interested to keep perceiving communication strategy as just different effort expenditure to best function for my own and other communication styles!
