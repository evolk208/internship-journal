# May 24th: Professional Services Open Meeting

On my third day of work, we had a share-out meeting with all of the Professional Services individuals working in the Denver office, which was open to the whole office. We had two guests with us for this meeting: Andy Schulte and Eric Floss. This was the perfect chance to get a broad scope of Professional Services operating out of the Denver office in my very first week, and I loved hearing about everyone's projects, clients, and teams through Esri. 

## Aviation
The meeting opened with my manager for this summer, Will Reynolds, presenting about work with the aviation industry. He outlined the Esri initiatives making charts based on different standards and data unique to airports or divisions in the aviation industry. It was interesting to note that most charts for aviation are still printed, and so have to be constructed with print in mind. Work in this industry must accomodate many different sets of data, workflow, and specifications, which is still largely unstandardized across global locations. 

## Non-profit/NGOs
Sam Libby followed up Will with a succinct presentation about ArcGIS in the nonprofit setting. Excitingly, he opened his presentation with an update on the incorporation of Open Street Map data into more detailed layers in ArcGIS. It was also great to hear the significant discounts on ArcGIS available to nonprofits and NGOS: pretty much a 97% decrease in cost. 

## Utilities/Mining
Following this presentation, we heard Will R give a brief outline of work in the utilities and mining industry, where I began to wonder about one of the corporate acronyms new to me here at Esri (EEAP, which stands for Esri Enterprise Advantage Program). An interesting note from this short presentation covering a variety of work was that mining is generally an industry conservative on spending due to volatile commodities markets. I have a lot more to learn about how Esri interacts directly and indirectly with utilities and mining companies. 

## Commercial 
Next, Phil shared about the commercial sector. In the commercial sector, Esri is in the process of developing "Offerings," which are collections/packages of key configurable apps specialized for industries. These sound similar to the work Professional Services shares with clients through developing web applications for specific use cases. 

At this point, I think we ate pizza. 

## Transportation
Next, we heard an in-depth presentation from Eric on Esri's work in the transportation sector, including local work with CDOT, the Colorado Department of Transportation. This, to me, sounds like one of the greatest areas of growth and contracting for Esri and ArcGIS. I can pretty easily grasp the necessity of using GIS and location data in developing public transit and other DOT needs. We heard a great account of a successful web application tracking snow removal for the NYDOT. On the web application side, it was interesting to hear that Esri has the goal of developing 60-70 targeted, simple, high volume and high velocity web applications housed in a single web destination also housing maps and data. This is a very exciting initiative to me. 

## NGA
I was most confused by a short presentation on Esri's work with NGA and FGM, mainly because I was not previously familiar with these acronyms. Now I know that NGA stands for National Geospatial Agency, and is Esri's #1 customer. Kristin shared work she has been doing with FGM developing human geography documentation and data organization and collaboration. This sounds very interesting. This particular data sounds both integral to save, share, and map, and also extremely difficult to standardize and streamline. I think I would like to connect with her more about this. 

## Port of Rotterdam
Jeremy then went through a recap of work with the Port of Rotterdam. I had explored aspects of this project and Esri's work with the Port of Rotterdam, but I was incredibly amazed with this discussion of scale. It is a MASSIVE port, with massive use of the ArcGIS platform. The Port of Rotterdam also seeks to be a fully autonomous port, which will be exciting to follow and develop IoT softward for. I also liked hearing about the Geo Design integration of ArcGIS to balance efficiency, physical geography, and more. There was a short graphic of a map tracking tidal salinity changes in the port which got be very excited about this work, GIS, and my internship and work with this data visualization. 

## Operations 
Amanda then shared details about Operations. It was great to hear that Esri provides Travel Security Assessments, of course including nice mpas, for wherever staff members are sent for foreign work. 

## Web Development 
Finally, Josh and Gary shared projects happening through our Web Development team. They shared updates about the IRWIN web application for the integrated reporting of wildland fire initiative, which consolidates all indident reporting of wildland fire across the nation into one searchable web application that also factors in which sources can be considered most authoritative for elements of incident reporting. This map just displays points in its visualization, which was interesting to note, because most use of reporting data needs number of incidents for analysis. Josh also presented that we are starting to fashion ArcGIS Analytics for Internet of Things, which will be an online application. Additionally, Gary presented a new visualization for the US Census, and noted that front end visualization is becoming even more important than backend data organization as visualizations excell. The US Census has ArcGIS backend, but front end must catch up to make the most engaging, visually appealing, and informative front end visualizations. Gary also shared work with CAT for monitering machines, which was crazy--I had never thought about the scale of machine monitoring and data collection. 

## Andy 
Finally, Andy Schulte, who joined Esri a short 1.5 years ago, shared his new perspective on Esri organization. I took the following points away from his presentation the most: 
- There must be discipline for small changes as well as large changes, or at least a way to capture effort expended for small changes to track them as they add up. I thought this point was interesting for it's respect of time, and boundary setting, as small changes sum to large effort in any industry or work. 
- Esri is developing an internal job board, which was mentioned in my internship onboarding. This sounds like it will increase personal growth throughout Esri. 
- My favorite new term that Andy presented, that I had not heard of before, was "Lifelines framework." Lifelines frameworks encompass personal and professional growth through different aspects of community leadership, including shadowing, coaching, and mentoring. I love this term for community education and growth. 
- Andy also brought up "Knowledge management," which is something I want to study and look into more. 

## Technical Consulting Program (TCP) 
Jan finished off the presentations with a sketch of the Technical Consulting Program, which I find very intruiging. 

## Me! 
Lastly, I capped off the meeting with a short presentation of my Story Map Introduction (see previous post), and felt closer with the team already!
